# 4.14 (Computer-Assisted Instruction) Computer-assisted instruction (CAI) refers to the
# use of computers in education. Write a script to help an elementary school student learn
# multiplication.
# Create a function that randomly generates and returns a tuple of two positive one-digit integers.
# Use that functionâ€™s result in your script to prompt the user with a question, such as How much is 6 times 7?
# For a correct answer, display the message "Very good!" and ask another multiplication
# question. For an incorrect answer, display the message "No. Please try again." and let
# the student try the same question repeatedly until the student finally gets it right.
