# 4.6 (Modified average Function) The average function we defined in Section 4.11
# can receive any number of arguments. If you call it with no arguments, however, the function
# causes a ZeroDivisionError. Reimplement average to receive one required argument
# and the arbitrary argument list argument *args, and update its calculation
# accordingly. Test your function. The function will always require at least one argument,
# so youâ€™ll no longer be able to get a ZeroDivisionError. When you call average with no
# arguments, Python should issue a TypeError indicating "average() missing 1 required
# positional argument."

def average(arg, *args):
    parameter = sum(int(arg + args))
    operands = arg + args
    print(parameter / len(operands))


average(5, 10)
average(5, 10, 15)
