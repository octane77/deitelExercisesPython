# # 4.5 (Fill in the Missing Code?) Replace the ***s in the seconds_since_midnight function
# # so that it returns the number of seconds since midnight. The function should receive
# # three integers representing the current time of day. Assume that the hour is a value from
# # 0 (midnight) through 23 (11 PM) and that the minute and second are values from 0 to 59.
# # Test your function with actual times. For example, if you call the function for 1:30:45 PM
# # by passing 13, 30 and 45, the function should return 48645.
