# 5.4 (Iteration Order) Create a 2-by-3 list, then use a nested loop to:
# a) Set each elementâ€™s value to an integer indicating the order in which it was processed
# by the nested loop.
# b) Display the elements in tabular format. Use the column indices as headings
# across the top, and the row indices to the left of each row.
